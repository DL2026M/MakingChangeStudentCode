| January 21st | 1:00pm - 1:45pm | The problem set was introduced to me during this time and I began to brainstorm solutions. I used the whiteboards in the classrooms with my peers to go through practice examples with only a few different types of coins and a small total sum. We came up with a few different strategies, though they seemed to hard to get working for large test cases. |
| January 26th | 4:45pm - 5:30pm | During this time I thought more about the project and then wrote code for the case where there is only 1 type of coin. The code checks to see if the target sum is evenly divisible by the one coin, and if it is, then return that number. I thought more about how I would approach this (and solve the problem efficiently), but nothing solid came to my mind. |
| January 26th | 5:45pm - 6:45pm | I did some more research on how to solve this problem and dynamic programming seems to be a very good approach on how to solve this problem (though not required I think). An idea that I can across with is to have a bunch of different buckets (the total being the most amount of the smallest coins needed to ge the sum), and adding the next denomination coin to the first bucket, then adding 2 the next bucket, etc until there is no more buckets / room left. I also looked into creating a formula that would solve this issue in only a few lines of code but that seems to complicated for all of the different type of coins so I won't do that. |
| January 30th | 1:00pm - 1:45pm | I started working on the recursive approach the problem during this class time. I wrote out my base cases and wrote the call to the recursive function, but couldn't get it working. My indexes and sums variables were in the wrong places and mixed up, which was quite confusing to debug. |
| February 1st | 3:00pm - 4:30pm | I figured out my errors in the recursive function (I was putting my variables in the wrong parameters when I called the function again and wasn't checking to see if the spot had already been visited). Once I got the memoization/recursive function completed and working, I began tabulation by writing the base case (making the 2nd column of the 2d array be filled with 1's). After writing the exclude and include case, I kept on getting out of bound errors. I spent a lot of time moving and changing small things in my code to get it to work (I needed to have <= not just < on some of the for loops, and +1 on the coins.length for the size of the 2d array). |
