I used the whiteboards in the classrooms with my peers to go through practice examples with only a few different types of coins and a small total sum. We came up with a few different strategies, though they seemed to hard to get working for large test cases. |
| January 26th | 4:45pm - 5:30pm | During this time I thought more about the project and then wrote code for the case where there is only 1 type of coin. The code checks to see if the target sum is evenly divisible by the one coin, and if it is, then return that number. I thought more about how I would approach this (and solve the problem efficiently), but nothing solid came to my mind.
